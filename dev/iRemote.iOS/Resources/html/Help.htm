    <p> 
        <b>iRemote Suite</b> is iPhone application that allows you to manipulate your workstation or notebook.
    </p>    
    <p class="title">
        1. Requirements
    </p>    
    <p class="subtitle">
        Network neighborhood
    </p>
    <p>
        Network neighborhood is the primary thing you need to take an advantage of using this software. 
        At first, you need local area network to be able to connect your desktop or notebook. 
        And finally, you need WiFi router to be able to connect your iPhone to your local network.
    </p>    
    <p>
        The scenario may be easier, of course, if you have a notebook with embedded WiFi module which is 
        capable to create Ad Hoc network. In this case you can connect your iPhone to notebook directly
        without mediators.
    </>
    <p class="subtitle">
        Host application
    </p>
    <p>
        Before you launch your mobile client you have to download and install host application,
        which is called <b>Remote PC Suite</b> on your desktop system. 
        You may found latest binaries for your platform at <br/>
            <a href="http://www.scientific-soft.com/mobile/apps/iremote/">http://www.scientific-soft.com/mobile/apps/iremote/</a> <br/>
        <b>Note:</b> 
        Binaries for your desktop system are always FREE. 
        And what is much more important is that you should not download binaries from third-party mirrors. 
        The only authorized distributor of <b>Remote PC Suite</b> is <b>Scientific Software</b>. 
        Please, use authorized mirror to protect your system.    
    </p>
    
    <p class="title">
        2. Connecting to Host
    </p>      
    <p>
        The only way to connect to your host is to take an advantage of TCP/IP networking.
        It means that you have to specify IP address and PORT of your desktop to establish the connection.
    </p>    
    <p>
        <b>Remote PC Suite</b> provides you a way to acquire your IP address easily.
        It is displayed at the bottom of Remote PC Suite main window.
    </p>
    <p class="image">

        Part of host application window with ip combo box.
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>Advanced</i> <br/>
        The software uses port number 8444 by default. It may occur so, that another software (on your desktop)
        uses the same port number. In this case you will be prompted with an error when you launch
        <b>Remote PC Suite</b>. You will have to choose another port value and specify it while logging in
        with <b>iRemote Suite</b>.
    </p>

        iRemote login page with ip and port populated.
    </p>
    <p>
        Press ‘Catch’ button to establish connection with host application which should be launched on your workstation.     
    </p>
    <p>
        It is now possible to remember your device on the desktop. 
        This feature allows you to connect to a host remotely.
        You will need to enter password on the device just once.
    </p>
    <p class="image">
        <img src="./Help003.jpg"/> <br/>
        Password request in iRemote.
    </p>   
    <p>
        After successful connection attempt, you will have this host on the list and will be able to connect to it 'in a click' 
        without any confirmations on desktop side.
    </p> 
    <p class="image">
        <img src="./Help007.jpg"/> <br/>
        List of known hosts.
    </p>   
    <p>
        Here you can select any particular host to connect to it immediately. 
        You are also able to remove hosts from the list in standard iPhone way.
    </p>     
    <p>
    	You can get one of the following erros, when attempting to extablish connection with the host:
    </p>
    <p>
    	<ul>
        	<li>
            	<i>Failed to connect to host.</i> <br/> 
                <p>
                    This error occurs, when target host is not accessible.
                    Check whether IP address and port values are correct and ensure that Remote PC Suite is launched.
                    You can also try to restart Remote PC Suite on the host.
            	</p>
            </li>
        	<li>
            	<i>Connection is terminated by host.</i> <br/>     
            	<p>
                    Host application terminated connection for some reason. 
                    This error occurs, when user disconnects device by means of Remote PC Suite, or
                    Remote PC Suite is terminated.                
				</p>                
            </li>
        	<li>
            	<i>Limit of connections is reached.</i> <br/>            	
                <p>
                    The only device is allowed to be connected to the host at the moment.
                    You will get this error, if you try to connect a device, when another device is already connected.
                </p>
            </li>
        	<li>
            	<i>Wrong device IP address.</i> <br/>            	
                <p>
                    If you create a rule for your device (remember it on the host), the device is associated with its cureent IP address.
                    If device IP address is changed for some reason, you have to proceed to 
                    Remote PC-&gt;User's Manager-&gt;<i>Your Device</i> and modify IP address.
                    If device IP is frequently changed, you can turn this feature off at the same place.
                    Just leave 'Associate with IP address' checkbox blank.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

        4. Shell
    </p> 
    <p>
        This feature provides you with a chance to get access to native desktop system command interpreter from your iPhone.
        You are able to configure your system, launch applications and do lots of other things by means of command interpreter.
        Native interpreter for Mac platform is <b>Bash</b>. 
        Windows runs <b>cmd.exe</b> for the same purposes, but it's functionality is much more limited.
    </p>
    <p>
    	It is almost impossible to cover all shell scripting topics for both Mac and Windows platforms in a single manual.
        If you are totally unfamiliar with command prompts, you can type 'dir' to get the contents of current directory 
        under Windows system, or 'ls' to do the same thing under Mac.

    </p>
    <p class="subtitle">
    	Important notes:
    </p>    
    <p>
    	<ul>
        	<li>
            	<p>
                    <b>Windows</b>. When attempting to launch an application by means of iRemote you must use 'start $app name$'
                    syntax instead of just '$app name$'. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
            	<p>
                    Some shell commands (such as 'ping') do not return execution to the commands interpreter immediately. 
                    If you run one of such commands and disconeect from the host, it (command) will continue execution in the background.
                    When you extablish connection again, you will see new messages, coming from the shell.
                    Note, that you will get only new messages, when connection is extablished. 
                    Remote PC Suite does not caches messages, when there are no connected clients.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can use 'Ctrl-C' button (at top left corner) to terminate such command. 
                    This button actually simulates Ctrl-C combination.
                </p>
            </li>
			<li>
            	<p>
					Each connected device gets access to desktop shell without a warning of any kind.				
                </p>
			</li>
			<li>
            	<p>
                    Network interaction between Remote PC Suite and iRemote Suite is not encrypted.
                    This means that, all your commands and server responses are transferred as is. 
                </p>
			</li>
            <li>
            	<p>
                    A number of lines in shell view on the device is limited to 128.
                    This limitations is caused by performance considerations.
                    User interface of iRemote may become sluggish, if shell command outputs huge amount of data
                    (try 'man bash' on MacOSX for an example).
                    This is generally caused by shell view control, and will be fixed in future iRemote releases.

        6. Full Size Keyboard
    </p> 
    <p>
        This feature provides you with a chance to do almost everything you can do with your regular keyboard. 
        Of course, due to its size it may not efficiently replace desktop one. 
    </p>  

	<p class="title">
        7. Settings
    </p> 
	<p class="subtitle">
        Pan Mode
    </p>  
    <p>
		Default mode assumes that mouse cursor moves in the same direction finger moves along the screen surface.
	</p>	
	<p class="image">
        <img src="./Help011.jpg"/> <br/> 
        Inverse panning (default mode).

	<p class="image">
        <img src="./Help012.jpg"/> <br/> 
        Direct panning. 
    </p>
	<p>
		The best way to understand the difference and to pick the most appropriate mode is to try both!
    </p>  
	<p class="subtitle">
        Autorotation
    </p>  
    <p>
		This option allows you to disable touch pad autorotation, when device orientation changes.
    </p>
    
    <p class="title">
        8. Sleep Mode
    </p> 
    <p>
        <b>iRemote Suite</b> terminates connection with the host as soon as device goes to sleep mode.
        When device wakes up, the application attempts to reestablish the connection.
        You will not prompted for confirmation in this case for convenience.
        Application exchanges security cookie with the host any time, when you prove authenticaiton
        request clicking 'Allow' button in <b>Remote PC</b>, and uses this cookie to 
        reconnect automatically.
    </p> 
    <p>        
        <b>iRemote Suite</b> does not prevents for the device to go to sleep to increase battery life.
    </p>   

    <p class="title">
        9. Limitations
    </p> 
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                iRemote Suite (by means of Host Application) does not simulate DirectInput events.
            </li>
            <li>
                You may connect the only device running iRemote Suite to your host at the time.
            </li>            
        </ul>
